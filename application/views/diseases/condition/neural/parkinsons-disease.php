                                <p> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. This loss leads to a deficiency in dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for coordinating movement. The primary symptoms of PD include tremors, bradykinesia (slowed movement), rigidity, and postural instability.</p>
                                <p> The pathology of Parkinson's disease involves the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein aggregates, known as Lewy bodies, within neurons. These aggregates disrupt cellular function and contribute to neuronal dysfunction and eventual cell death. Additionally, there is evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation in the brains of individuals with PD, further exacerbating the neurodegenerative process. </p>
