											<h2 class="h1">Unlocking Hope: StemRx Hospital's Revolutionary Approach to Alopecia Areata Treatment</h2>
										</div>
										<div class="">
											<h2>About the disease:</h2>
											<p>Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden loss of hair in localized patches on the scalp or body. The exact etiology remains elusive, but it is believed to involve a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and aberrant immune responses targeting hair follicles. Histologically, alopecia areata is characterized by peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrates around the affected hair follicles, leading to their premature termination of the anagen phase and subsequent hair shedding. The condition may present with varying degrees of severity, ranging from small, asymptomatic patches to extensive hair loss across the entire scalp or body.</p>
