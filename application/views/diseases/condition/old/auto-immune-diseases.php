					<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">The immune system’s blood cells play a role in defending the body from harmful substances. Examples include germs, viruses, poisons, cancer cells, as well as blood and tissue from external sources. Antigens are present on these substances. In order to eliminate these dangerous compounds, the immune system creates antibodies against certain antigens.</p>
					<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">When the immune system fails to discriminate between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens then one may have an autoimmune illness. Because of this, the body starts a reaction that kills healthy tissues. Autoimmune illnesses have no known specific etiology. According to one notion, certain medications, or microbes (such as bacteria or viruses) may cause alterations that cause the immune system to get confused. People with genes that make them more susceptible to autoimmune illnesses may experience this more frequently.</p>
