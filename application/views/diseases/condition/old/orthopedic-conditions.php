						<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">
							The muscles, tendons, joints, ligaments, bones, and nerves make up the musculoskeletal system, which provides the body with support and mobility. Any component of the musculoskeletal system can get affected by orthopedic disorders. The major root cause of orthopedic diseases is age-dependent wear and tear, particularly those that affect the spine and joints. Orthopedic diseases can also be caused by trauma, overuse, and repeated motions. Common orthopedic diseases include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, tendinitis, bursitis, and trauma-related injuries such as fractures and dislocations. Treatment may include medications, physical therapy, and, in severe cases, surgery.

						<h2 class="h1 title-divider">WHAT CAUSES ORTHOPEDIC DISEASES?</h2>
						<!--<p>One of the most common cosmetic concerns is skin texture. Uneven skin texture can result from a buildup of dead skin cells, acne, or scarring. To improve skin texture, individuals can use exfoliating products or seek professional treatments such as chemical peels or microdermabrasion. Another important aspect of cosmetic condition is skin color. Skin can become discolored due to factors such as sun damage, hormonal changes, or aging. Hydration level is also an essential component of cosmetic condition. Dehydrated skin can appear dull and lackluster, while properly hydrated skin appears plump and healthy. Hair and nails are other areas of consideration to cosmetic condition. Hair can become dry and brittle due to factors such as heat styling, chemical treatments, or poor nutrition. Nails can become brittle or discolored due to factors such as nutritional deficiencies or trauma.</p>-->
						<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">Damage to muscle can cause immobility and pain in various joints such as the head, neck, etc. Thus, affecting the overall ability of the patient to sit, stand, walk, and control head-neck movements. </p>
						<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">Some of the neurological causes include uncontrolled neuromuscular breakdown, thus, affecting the strength and functioning across the brain (hind regions) and spinal cord which affects the signal transduction to extremities which progresses to motor neuron diseases</p>

						<!--<h2 class="h1 title-divider">WHAT ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF ORTHOPEDIC DISEASES?</h2>-->
						<!--<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">Orthopedic impairment can be broadly classified into two categories: congenital and acquired. Congenital impairment refers to those that occur during birth, while acquired impairment may result from factors such as injuries, surgeries, or medical conditions.</p>-->
						<!--                  <p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2">Congenital orthopedic disability is a condition that affects a child’s musculoskeletal system, which is present at the time of birth and generally begins before birth. On the other hand, Acquired orthopedic disability is a condition that a person can develop after birth because of an injury or disease. It can also happen due to trauma during the birthing process.</p>-->

					<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2 text-center">“We carry our own repairing tool” is the patented technology of the StemRx for repairing joints, fractures, etc. MSCs are isolated from the connective tissue surrounding organs. MSCs are usually harvested via bone marrow aspirate for orthopedic applications. Pain and bleeding and age-related degeneration can be one of the most prominent causes of inactive differentiation of viable cells. Adipose tissue is the next most common source of MCSs for musculoskeletal applications. </p>
					<p class="fs-md text-title mb-4 pb-2 text-center">MSCs are used as a stand-alone therapy in the form of an injection or in combination with scaffolds. The incorporation of cell-based therapy along with vibration therapy activates and rebalances skeletal muscle. When there is edema due to underlying inflammation, it can cause spasticity of cells causing the cells to oscillate thus limiting the oxygen saturation across the skeletal muscle interface. Vibration therapy involves the application of an external frequency of 8-12Hz is applied across the inflamed area to reestablish the cellular function thereby improving the microcirculation to provide relaxation of tissue, muscle, and facia. Thus, Cell-based therapy can provide healing effects in different orthopedic conditions using the concept.</p>
